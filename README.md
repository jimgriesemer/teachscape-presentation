What needs to be updated/added
-------------------------
* Buttons in the disabled state should be gray and not an opacity of the existing color. File: buttons.less, variable.less
* Checkboxes and radio buttons should be custom icons with a proper disabled state. Disabled checkboxes and radio buttons should be visually flat. Currently they are just dimmed out with a convex shape.
